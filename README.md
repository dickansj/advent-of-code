# Advent of Code
_Working through AoC 2020 with R_

This repo includes my solutions and input data for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

#### Caveat:
- I am not a programmer, and while I have some experience with programming/R fundamentals, it is likely the solutions here will not be the most efficient (and that some days I will not have a solution). But I'm using AoC as a learning experience. Feedback welcome.

#### Libraries/Packages Utilized:
- [tidyverse](tidyverse.org)
- devtools (required for the next one)
- [aocodeR](https://github.com/annakrystalli/aocodeR) - to read in input
